# Defender

This is a simple console-based C++ game inspired by the game [_Defender_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_(1981_video_game)),
which was released in 1981 for various platforms, including the Atari 2600, Commodore 64, IBM PC and arcades.
It's a side-scroller shooter game where you control a spaceship and must defeat all enemies in the level.

_Defender_ was inspired by other space-related games of its time, such as [_Space Invaders_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders)
and [_Asteroids_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)), and made the side-scroller
[_shoot 'em up_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up) genre popular.
